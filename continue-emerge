# Script that retries a failing emerge

# I think there is a manufacturing fault with my CPU or my memory. Compiles somtimes randomly fail.
# This script resumes the emerge compile where it left off instead of starting over.
#
# NOTE: If you try to resume a failed compile the day after it failed it will start over anyway because of timestamps.
